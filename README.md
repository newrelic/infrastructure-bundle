# New Relic infrastructure monitoring bundle

Build tooling to generate and release New Relic's containerised **bundle** for infrastructure monitoring, including the on-host agent, service integrations, and discovery tools.

## Requirements

- Docker (with buildx set up if multiarch building is desired)
- Go (for the downloader)
- *nix compatible shell (verified to work on Linux and OSX)

## Installation and usage

For install instructions, see [Docker container for infrastructure monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/docker-container-infrastructure-monitoring).

## Configuration

New Relic will keep latest stable agent and integrations versions in the [`bundle.yml` file](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-bundle/blob/master/bundle.yml).

> You can edit the file and set your desired versions, at your own risk.

## Building

Building multiarch images requires a working setup of [docker buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/).
A working installation of Go is also needed for running the downloader program.

```bash
DOCKER_PLATFORMS=linux/amd64 ./run-ci-locally.sh
```

### Without `docker buildx`

A single-arch image can also be built without `buildx`. However, setting `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` might be required for older versions of docker, otherwise the `TARGETOS` and `TARGETARCH` variables won't be populated and docker will fail to copy the integrations from the host.

```bash
# Run downloader script
go run downloader.go

# Build image
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -t newrelic/infrastructure-bundle:dev
```

## Release

CI workflow pushes the multiarch image to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/infrastructure-bundle/tags) by running `docker buildx` with `--push` whenever a release or prerelease is published in Github. The tag is generated from the release tag (after stripping the leading `v`). Additionally, prereleases will have an `-rc` suffix automatically appended to the tag.

Locally, this can be also be done with the `./run-ci-locally.sh` script:

```bash
DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=0.0.1-rc ./run-ci-locally.sh release
```

## Bumping versions

Versions, urls, and architectures of the bundled integrations are defined in `bundle.yml`.

The version of the [base agent image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/newrelic/infrastructure/tags) is also defined in `bundle.yml`, and is collected by the `docker-build.sh` wrapper script.
